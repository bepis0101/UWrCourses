//    * Mono is not installed or added to PATH, benchmark '_Benchmark.calc: Mono(Runtime=Mono)' will not be executed

// Benchmark _Benchmark.calc: Mono(Runtime=Mono)
//    * The Roslyn toolchain is only supported on .NET Framework

// Benchmark _Benchmark._calc: Mono(Runtime=Mono)

//    * Assembly lista5 which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
